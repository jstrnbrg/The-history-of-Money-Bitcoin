## Project description
The basic idea is to create an app that explains the origins of money, what money even is, why bitcoin is important and why it could (will) be the next step in monetary evolution and at the end give some tips on how to get started, i.e where to buy, where to store etc.
This app seems great as a base and can be adapt it to our content/needs as necessary.
HistoryOfEverything: https://github.com/2d-inc/HistoryOfEverything
The app is open-source under a MIT License.

Similarly to that app, I would structure everything into a few different mega-chapters/epoches and then have 5-10 shorter chapter in these epoches, each with a reading time of up to 5 minutes.
For a preliminary draft of the epoches and chapters please see below at.
Each chapter should have a few "deep dive" resource links at the bottom.

## Contributor workflow

The content is maintained using the "contributor workflow" where everyone without exception contributes patch proposals using "pull requests".
This facilitates social contribution, easy testing and peer review.

To contribute a patch, the workflow is as follows:

  1. Fork repository
  2. Create topic branch
  3. Commit patches
  4. Push changes to your fork
  5. Create pull request to

In general [commits should be regard one chapter/topic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_commit#Atomic_commit_convention) and diffs should be easy to read.

Commit messages should be verbose by default consisting of a short subject line (50 chars max), a blank line and detailed explanatory text as separate
paragraph(s), unless the title alone is self-explanatory (like "Corrected typo in Makefile") in which case a single title line is sufficient.

Further explanation [here](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

If a particular commit references another issue, please add the reference. For example: `refs #1234` or `fixes #4321`.

Please refer to the [Git manual](https://git-scm.com/doc) for more information about Git.

If a pull request is not to be considered for merging (yet), please prefix the title with [WIP] or use [Tasks Lists](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#task-lists) in the body of the pull request to indicate tasks are pending.


At this stage one should expect comments and review from other contributors.
You can add more commits to your pull request by committing them locally and pushing to your fork until you have satisfied all feedback.
