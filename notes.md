A wallet which is always connected to the Internet is called a hot wallet. Hot wallets are less secure compared to the cold wallet which is never connected to the internet. Since your mobile is a hot wallet, it is not advisable to keep a big amount of Bitcoin in it.

In this guide, you will learn how to receive-send Bitcoin with a mobile wallet. You will also learn - at a high level - how Bitcoin works and what is the importance of Bitcoin. At last, you will get some tips that can help you keep your Bitcoin safe from adversaries like hackers, central authorities and mistakes from your lack of technical knowledge.

Below are some ways you can get your first bitcoin.
1. Ask your Bitcoiner friend 
2. Look for nearby Bitcoin ATM
3. [Here] you can find some people who could be willing to gift you - or pay you for the service you can provide - a small amount of bitcoin for learning purpose.

Today one Bitcoin is worth nearly $5000. Getting one whole Bitcoin could be difficult. 1 Bitcoin (denoted as BTC) is divisible up to 100 Million parts. Thus the smallest possible amount of bitcoin is 0.00000001 BTC, which is also known as 1 satoshi (denoted as sat). Thus 1 sat = 0.00000001 BTC or 100,000,000 sat = 1 BTC.

Once someone is willing to send you Bitcoin, you need to give them a bitcoin address. (You can also receive bitcoin over the [lightning network](a link which leads to 'how to receive Bitcoin over lightning'). A Bitcoin address looks similar to this: 36Y2BC6LehT4YfKS89asiMcqebFMwYCLGY.

Then you may be asked to set up the pin to unlock the app every time you want to open it. These passphrase and 12 English Words are super critical information. If you uninstall the app, you lose the phone or you forget the pin, passphrase and 12 words are all you need to recover your bitcoin wallet. Write down this passphrase and 12 words on a paper.

Keep this paper at a secure place which waterproof and fireproof. 

Once the wallet is set up, you can generate a Bitcoin address. If the sender and you are at the same location, he can scan the QR code of your BItcoin address. If he is at a remote location, you can copy the address by touching on the address and send it by EMail or chat to the sender.
Once he sends the Bitcoin on your address, you should see the transaction in the app. If you touch on the transaction, you may find some details number of confirmations and transaction fees per byte. 
What is confirmation and what is the transaction fees? It is discussed later in the section. Once you get the bitcoin, you can send bitcoin to others. For that, you have to provide the Bitcoin address of the receiver and you have to choose how much transaction fee you want to pay. The wallet may recommend you how much fee you should pay. We learn about this in detail later.
